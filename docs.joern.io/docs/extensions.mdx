title: Developing Plugins
---

Joern can be enhanced via plugins. Plugins can


* access the Code Property Praph using the query language
and create new nodes, edges and properties via the DiffGraph
API.
* interface with arbitrary Java libraries to
e.g., access the filesystem or network, or data analysis capabilities.
* add new node and edge types can be added to the
schema, and the definition of existing node and edge types can be
modified.

In the simplest case, plugins add queries to Joern, as for example the
 `query-database` plugin does.

## Managing plugins

Plugins are  distributed as zip files containing Java archives. They
can be written in any JVM-based language, e.g., in Java, Scala, or
Kotlin.

Joern comes with a few plugins pre-installed. You can list installed
plugins using

```
joern --plugins
```

New plugins can be added:

```
joern --add-plugin <zipfile>
```

and removed:

```
joern --rm-plugin <name>
```
You can download an example plugin here for testing:

https://github.com/joernio/query-database/releases/latest/download/querydb.zip

## Developing your own plugin

We provide a sample plugin that you can use as a template. First,
make sure that dependencies are installed correctly:

*  Joern is installed in `~/bin/joern` (see
[Installation](/installation))
* The Scala Build Tool (SBT) in any version (via your package manager)


Next, issue the following commands to install the sample extension.

```
git clone https://github.com/joernio/sample-extension
cd sample-extension
./install.sh
cd ~/bin/joern/joern-cli
./joern
```

On the joern shell, type `run`. You should see the extension in the
overview:

![Run output](/img/run.png)

To run the extension, type `run.gitextension`. You can also
inspect/modify options passed to the plugin by typing
`opts.gitextension.<TAB>`.

## Importing into the IntelliJ IDE and running tests

Joern Extensions can be developed in an IDE and the process of
importing an extension may differ slightly from IDE to IDE. The
following instructions are for IntelliJ 2020.1.1.

Choose "Open or Import" to import the project.

![IntelliJ start screen](/img/startscreen.png)


Next, select the directory from the file selector. Assuming that your
IntelliJ installation has support for `sbt` installed, the import is
fully automated.

![Just select the project](/img/select.png)


Finally, navigate to `src/test/scala/io/shiftleft/gitextension` and
click on `GitextentionTests`. You can right-click on the class or the
individual tests to run them.

## Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies by modifying the variable
`libraryDependencies` in `build.sbt`:

```
// build.sbt
name := "joern-sample-extension"
ThisBuild/organization := "io.joern"
ThisBuild/scalaVersion := "2.13.0"

...

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   // Add your dependencies here
  "org.eclipse.jgit" % "org.eclipse.jgit" % "5.7.0.202003110725-r",
  // ...
  "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.1.1" % Test
)

...
```

If the dependency is not shipped with joern, please also make sure to
copy it to joern's `lib` directory on installation by editing
`install.sh`. (We may have already automated this step at the time of
reading):

```
// install.sh
...
echo "Installing jars into: ${JAR_INSTALL_DIR}"
cp target/universal/stage/lib/io.joern.joern-sample-extension-*.jar ${JAR_INSTALL_DIR}
cp target/universal/stage/lib/org.eclipse.jgit.org.eclipse.jgit* ${JAR_INSTALL_DIR}
// Copy any jars you need to be installed for the plugin into $JAR_INSTALL_DIR
cp target/universal/stage/lib/... ${JAR_INSTALL_DIR}
...
```

## Extending the CPG schema

You can make additions to the CPG schema specification by placing
`.json` files in `schema/src/main/resources/schema/`. A sample schema
extension is provided that adds an edge of type "FOO" that is valid
from `FILE` nodes to `METHOD` nodes.


```
schema/src/main/resources/schema/ext.json

{
  "edgeTypes" : [
    {"id" : 9000, "name": "FOO", "comment" : "Foo edge", "keys": []}
  ],

  "nodeTypes" : [
      { "name" : "FILE", "outEdges" : [{"edgeName": "FOO", "inNodes": [{"name": "METHOD"}]}] }
  ]
}

```
