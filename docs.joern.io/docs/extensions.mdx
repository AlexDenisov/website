title: Extending Joern
---

Joern provides a runtime extension mechanism that allows you to
develop custom analyzers on top of the platform. Extensions are
programs for the JVM that can be written in Java, Scala or
Kotlin. They can access the Code Property Praph via a query language
and create new nodes, edges and properties via the DiffGraph
API. Moreover, they can interface with Java libraries to accomplish
different tasks, like accessing the network or writing to the file
system. Finally, even new node and edge types can be added to the
schema, and the definition of existing node and edge types can be
modified.

## Starting off with the sample extension

We provide a sample extension that you can use as a template. First,
make sure that dependencies are installed correctly:

*  Joern is installed in `~/bin/joern` (see
[Installation](/installation))
* The Scala Build Tool (SBT) in any version (via your package manager)


Next, issue the following commands to install the sample extension.

```
git clone https://github.com/joernio/sample-extension
cd sample-extension
./install.sh
```
