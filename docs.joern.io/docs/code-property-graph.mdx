The code property graph is a data structure designed to mine large
codebases for instances of programming patterns. These patterns are
formulated in a domain-specific language (DSL) based on
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). It serves as a single
intermediate program representation across all languages supported by
Joern and its commercial brother [Ocular](https://www.shifleft.io/).

Property graphs are a generic abstraction supported by many
contemporary graph databases such as [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/),
[OrientDB](https://orientdb.com/), and
[JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org/). In fact, [older versions of
Joern](https://github.com/fabsx00/joern-old) made use of general
purpose graph databases as a storage backend and the graph query
language [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html). As the
limitations of this approach became more apparent over the years, we
replaced both the storage backend and query language with our own
graph database
[OverflowDB](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/overflowdb).

ShiftLeft has open-sourced the [implementation of the code property
graph](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/codepropertygraph) and its
specification.

## Building Blocks of Code Property Graphs

Code property graphs are
[graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)),
and more specifically [property
graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.1001.pdf). A property graph is
composed of the following building blocks:

- **Nodes and their types.** Nodes represent program
  constructs. This includes low-level language constructs such as
  methods, variables, and control structures, but also higher level
  constructs such as HTTP endpoints or findings. Each node has a
  type. The type indicates the type of program construct represented
  by the node, e.g., a node with the type `METHOD` represents a method
  while a node with type `LOCAL` represents the declaration of a local
  variable.

- **Labeled directed edges.**
  Relations between program constructs are represented via edges
  between their corresponding nodes. For example, to express that a
  method contains a local variable, we can create an edge with the
  label `CONTAINS` from the method's node to the local's node. By
  using labeled edges, we can represent multiple types of relations in
  the same graph. Moreover, edges are directed to express, e.g., that
  the method contains the local but not the other way around. Multiple
  edges may exist between the same two nodes.

- **Key-Value Pairs.**
  Nodes carry key-value pairs (attributes), where the valid
  keys depend on the node type. For example, a method has at
  least a name and a signature while a local declaration has at
  least the name and the type of the declared variable.

In summary, code property graphs are directed, edge-labeled,
attributed multigraphs, and we insist that each node carries at least
one attribute that indicates its type.


## Node Types of the Base Specification

This section describes all node types of the base specification in
detail.

### MetaData

Signature:

`MetaData(language : String, version: String,
overlays: List[String], [hash : String])`

Layer: Base

Each CPG has exactly one MetaData node. The node holds the following
information about the CPG generation:

* `language`: the CPG language frontend that generated this CPG.
* `version`: The version of the CPG spec
* `overlays`: The list of overlays that have been applied to create this graph
* `hash`: The artifact that this graph was generated from.

The `overlays` field does not have to be set by the language frontend. Upon
first loading the CPG, Joern/Ocular will add the semantic CPG layer, and
hence, when the user first sees this field, it should start with the entry
`semanticcpg`. Note that the base layer is not considered an overlay and 
therefore it is not added to the `overlays` list.

No incoming or outgoing edges are permitted for the meta data node.

### `AstNode`

Signature: `AstNode(order : Int)`

`AstNode` is the base node type for all nodes that are part of syntax trees 
stored in the graph. In a syntax tree, sibling nodes (nodes who share a 
parent node) are ordered. As some graph databases do not guarantee the order 
in which siblings are returned to be stable, we make the ordering explicit 
by storing the position of each node relative to its siblings in the `order` 
field. In the left most sibling, `order` is set to `0`, while in the 
right-most sibling, it is set to `n-1` where `n` is the number of siblings.

### `File`

Signature: `File(name: String, [hash: String])` is an `AstNode`
Layer: Semanticcpg
Planned changes: File nodes shall no longer inherit from `AstNode` and shall 
only allow incoming `SOURCE_FILE` edges.

Code property graphs are created from sets of files. Information about these 
files is stored in the graph to enable queries to map nodes of the graph 
back to the files that contain the code they represent.

For each file, the graph must contain exactly one `File` node with the 
following fields:

* `name`: the absolute path of the file at CPG construction time in Unix style.
  No two file nodes of the CPG may have the same `name` field.
* `hash` (optional): A hash value calculated over the file contents.

As file nodes are root nodes of abstract syntax tress, they are `AstNodes` 
and their `order` field is set to `0`.

Each code property graph must contain a special file node with 
`name` set to `"<unknown>"`. This node is a placeholder used in cases 
where a file cannot be determined at compile time. As an example, consider 
the case where an external type is introduced only at link time.

Conceptually file nodes serve as indices, e.g., they map all filenames to the 
list of methods they contain.

`File` nodes MUST NOT be created by the language frontend. Instead, the 
language frontend is assumed to fill out the `FILENAME` field wherever 
possible, allowing `File` nodes to be created automatically when the 
semantic CPG layer is created.

A Look into the Rear-View Mirror

The Code Property Graph was first introduced in the paper [Modeling
and Discovering Vulnerabilities with Code Property
Graphs](https://fabs.codeminers.org/papers/2014-ieeesp.pdf) in the
context of vulnerability discovery for C system code and the Linux
kernel in particular. The core ideas outlined in this early work are
the following:

* Different classic program representations are merged into a property
  graph into a single data structure that holds information about the
  programâ€™s syntax, control- and intra-procedural data-flow.

* The property graph is stored in a graph database and made accessible
  via a domain specific language (DSL) for the identification of
  programming patterns - based on a DSL for graph traversals.

* The query language allows to seamlessly transition between the
original code representations, making it possible to combine aspects
of the code from different views these representations offer in a
single query.

From 2014-2016, research followed on (a) extending the concept for
interprocedural analysis, (b) using the graph as a basis for learning
typical data-flow patterns in a program, (c) the effects of
introducing further classic program representations such as dominator
trees, (d) and the applicability of the approach for dynamically-typed
languages such as PHP.

From 2017 onwards, the code property graph served as the technological
foundation for the static analysis solutions developed at ShiftLeft
Inc. The representation has since undergone heavy extensions and
transformations. At the statement and expression level, it has matured
into a generic container format which allows for hosting of graphs
generated by 8 different language frontends, to enable querying with
the same query language across programming languages. Moreover, the
concept of overlays was introduced to allow representing code
on different levels of abstraction, enabling transitioning
between these layers of abstraction using the query language in the
same way as for the original three low-level code
representations. Finally, programming models and APIs are now
available for parallel graph processing at low memory footprint - a
core ingredient for scaling the approach.
